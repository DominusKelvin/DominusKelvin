### Ahoy there!

I help web development teams [Ship less JavaScript™️](https://shiplessjavascript.com), teach [full-stack JavaScript](https://sailscasts.com), and, [build SaaS products](https://hagfish.io). 

**I am the [lead maintainer](https://twitter.com/Dominus_Kelvin/status/1669063700144070662?s=20) of [Sails](https://sailsjs.com)** - The web application framework for JavaScript. Check out [the official announcement blog post](https://blog.sailscasts.com/announcing-the-lead-maintainer-of-sails)

Currently building [Hagfish](https://hagfish.io) - a modern way for creators to manage, send and schedule invoices.

At the side, I'm a web development educator, building [Sailscasts](https://sailcasts.com) - the All-In-One Platform to master Sails and backend JavaScript.

I am also building [guppy](https://sailscast.com/guppy) - the tinker tool for backend JavaScript.

I recently started working on [The Boring JavaScript Stack](https://github.com/sailscastshq/boring-stack) to enable JavaScript developers to quickly build full-stack JavaScript applications with a focus on shipping rather than fighting with tools.
