### Hola amigo ðŸ‘‹

I make tools for developers, projects, and SaaS applications. 

Currently working as DevRel and JavaScript engineer at [Treblle](https://treblle.com) - A service that makes monitoring your APIs super easy and intuitive. 

At the side, I'm a web development educator, building [Sailscasts](https://sailcasts.com) - the All-In-One Platform to master Sails and backend JavaScript.

I am also building [guppy](https://sailscast.com/guppy) - the tinker tool for backend JavaScript.
