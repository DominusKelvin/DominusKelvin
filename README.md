### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I make tools for developers, projects, and SaaS applications. I'm also CTO at Quru Lab, a web and blockchain development shop in Agbor, Nigeria.

I write a little bit on my [blog](https://dominuskelvin.dev/blog) and [elsewhere](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/kelvin-omereshone/)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a SaaS idea I still haven't committed a single line of code too.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to speak Spanish fluently(which I pray happens).
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about JavaScript, Sails, Vue, Dart and technical writing
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can visit my [website](https://dominuskelvin.dev) or [tweet](https://twitter.com/dominus_kelvin at me
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I fancy one day being a Capoeira master and finally learn how to cook enough to impress my girlfriend.
