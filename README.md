### Hola amigo ðŸ‘‹

I make tools for developers, projects, and SaaS applications. I'm also a Sails.js/Node.js and Vue.js/React consultant.

I write a little bit on my [blog](https://dominuskelvin.dev/blog) and [elsewhere](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/kelvin-omereshone/)

- ðŸ”­ I am currently building [Sailscasts](https://sailscasts.com) - an online platform for quality screencasts on learning production-ready Node.js with the [Sails.js](https://sailsjs.com) framework.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to speak Spanish fluently(which I pray happens).
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about JavaScript, Sails, Vue, Dart and technical writing
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can visit my [website](https://dominuskelvin.dev) or [tweet](https://twitter.com/dominus_kelvin) at me
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I fancy one day being a Capoeira master and finally learn how to cook enough to impress my girlfriend.
