### Hola amigo ðŸ‘‹

I make tools for developers, projects, and SaaS applications. 

**I am the [lead maintainer](https://twitter.com/Dominus_Kelvin/status/1669063700144070662?s=20) of [Sails](https://sailsjs.com)** - The MVC framework for Node.js. Check out [the official announcement blog post](https://blog.sailscasts.com/announcing-the-lead-maintainer-of-sails)

Currently working as a Developer Advocate and JavaScript engineer at [Treblle](https://treblle.com) - A service that makes monitoring your APIs super easy and intuitive. 

At the side, I'm a web development educator, building [Sailscasts](https://sailcasts.com) - the All-In-One Platform to master Sails and backend JavaScript.

I am also building [guppy](https://sailscast.com/guppy) - the tinker tool for backend JavaScript.

I recently started working on [The Boring JavaScript Stack](https://github.com/sailscastshq/boring-stack) to enable JavaScript developers to quickly build full-stack JavaScript applications with a focus on shipping rather than fighting with tools. Check my [keynote](https://youtu.be/qX69jEyAIc0) on Sailsconf 2023 introducing this stack
